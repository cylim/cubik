<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About the Project

Cubik is a platform designed to revolutionize the way open-source projects are funded and supported. It is created with a developer-centric approach, catering to the unique challenges faced by developers while endorsing the power of community participation. 

Cubik is built on the Solana blockchain, which allows for fast, secure, and low-cost transactions. The platform is powered by a quadratic funding mechanism, which ensures that even small contributions can have a meaningful impact.  

#### Features
**Quadratic Voting**: Cubik integrates quadratic voting, ensuring that even small contributions can have a meaningful impact. This approach encourages equitable funding allocations.

**Active Community Participation**: Cubik fosters an engaged community that plays an essential role in resource distribution. This involvement ensures transparency and fairness.

**Developer Empowerment**: Developers can easily create profiles, showcase their projects, participate in hackathons, and apply for grants, all within a user-friendly interface.

**Decentralized Grant Allocation**: The platform conducts decentralized grant rounds, which allows the community to collectively decide on resource allocation, encouraging collective decision-making.
